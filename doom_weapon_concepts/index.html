    <h1>Doom weapon ideas</h1>
    <h2>Last updated : 5 April 2024 (<a href="/doom_weapon_concepts/changelog.html">View changelog</a>)</h2>
    <h3>Serves as both a way to write down my ideas as well as train my writing skills.</h3>
    <p>Quick notes :
        <ul>
            <li>Demon energy is sometimes dropped by demons on death. Bigger demons drop more.</li>
            <li>Grenades are sometimes dropped by former humans. Backpacks give 5.</li>
            <li>Durability weapons can break and must be repaired with repair kits.</li>
            <li>"Superior" means a special upgrade like in Pandemonia Insurrection.</li>
            <li>Level 0 is the baseline for artifacts.</li>
            <li>Lore is whatever. The war against hell is still going and shooting at it until it dies is still the best combat strategy.</li>
            <li>I don't have any plans to turn them into functional weapons.</li>
            <li>Number of weapons : <span id="weapon_amount">0</span></li>
        </ul>
