    <h1>OC collection</h1>
    <h2>I have a lot of OCs and need a way to list them in case I ever forget</h2>

    <h4>Quick description of the different worlds:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Real world : Where you (the one reading) is from. Has no characters because none of them are real.</li>
        <li>Dream world : Self-explanatory. Every dreaming consciousness gets transported over there in a self-contained bubble that lasts until they wake up. Bubbles can be broken, in which case the consciousness is unable to wake up, forced to wander a mostly empty and dark world.
            Time doesn't flow normally, and there's no correlation between time spent in the Dream world and the Real world. Characters I imagine in my dreams go here.</li>
        <li>Virtual world : Alternate versions of the Real world governed by video-game logic. I mostly use it for human characters and for a more down-to-earth/modern setting.</li>
        <li>Other : Reserved for characters that exist outside of the other worlds or that I don't know/haven't decided where to fit them.</li>
    </ul>
